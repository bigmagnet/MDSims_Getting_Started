File Type Guide. What are the file extensions.
CHARMM specific files:
.rtf
- rich text file
- CHARMM forcefield file
- stores the topology information (what are the atoms, how are they connected, what are their charges) of parameterized molecules
- more details: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/namd-tutorial-unix-html/node24.html

.prm
- parameter file
- CHARMM forcefield file
- stores the atom type masses, ideal bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles, and spring constants necessary for force calculations
- more details: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/namd-tutorial-unix-html/node25.html

.str
- CHARMM forcefield file
- contains both .rtf and .prm information
- commonly generated by the user using CHARMM-GUI/CGenFF program

.psf
- contains the same topology info as the rtf except applied to a specific system
- the result of applying the .str and .rtf to a pdb
- more details: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/namd-tutorial-unix-html/node23.html

Other files:
.pdb
- protein data bank file
- contains coordinates for all atoms + more info
- more details: see MDSim/user_guide/file_type_guide/pdb_file.png
- you will see similar colunms in pdbs and psfs. These contain all the system specific information necessary for a simulation.
    Therefore, any colunms that occur in both should match (residue name, segment name, etc.), as well as the atom number and atom order

.dcd
- contains the simulation trajectory (atom positions as a function of time)
- created by openmm

.npy
- numpy binary file
- read with np.load(), write with np.save()

.py
- python script (yay)
- added for completeness

.sh
- submit file
- run "qsub MDSim/submit/file.sh" to submit a series of commands to a requested subcluster
- more details: https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/services/researchcomputing/using/jobs/submitting/index.php

.ini
- configparser configuration file
- contains [sections], keys = values
- easily read a dictionary into a python script with the read_config function from params_validate.py.
